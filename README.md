Practose Online Consultation App

Practose is an implementation of online doctor consultation and appointment. The project is
implemented using MERN stack and is deployed on Heroku. We have implemented the
following use cases: management of appointment, online chat consultation and
recommendation of doctors based on symptoms specified.
Patients can create an account to the website. Doctors need to notify the admin and an
account will be created for them. Both Patients and Doctors can then log in into our website.
There is a separate UI for patients and doctors.
Patients will be able to book and schedule appointments based on the availability of doctors.
While booking appointments, the patients also choose if it's a routine check-up or not. The
patients will also be recommended doctors based on the symptoms specified by them. They
will be able to view a list of all the doctors initially and the doctors will get filtered according
to their specialization as the patients enter the symptoms.
There is also a chat window on the website where patients can interact with the doctor in case
of any queries or emergencies. The patients are only allowed to chat with doctors while the
doctors are allowed to chat with patients and with doctors also. Apart from this, any patient
will be able view all his previous and current appointments, delete an upcoming appointment.
The doctor will also be able to see all the appointments made under his name.
